                Amarpreet Osheen ma&rsquo;am was working as an English
                literature professor in Panjab University, Chandigarh and was
                brilliant at her job but she always use to feel for other and
                often due to a natural gift of face reading and aura readings
                she use to sense pain and sufferings of those around her and
                would often heal them with her words. Since a child she had the
                ability to connect with people on a deep emotional level and
                also had visions about the future in her dreams.

                She is deeply connected and concerned about animals, trees and
                mother nature in all forms. Born to a father who worked as an
                I.F.S officer, she spent most of her childhood watching her
                father saving nature and hence got emotionally attached to
                mother nature. Osheen Ma loves to spend her time in meditation
                in nature and is actively working to protect nature at all cost.

                One incident that changed the career path of Osheen ma was when
                the soul of her grandfather visited her in her dream before
                departing for his heavenly abode. In that dream her grandfather
                told her that her true purpose was to heal people and live a
                life dedicated to providing relief and encouragement to people
                who have lost all hope. He asked her to be the light for those
                standing in darkness.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify text-[15px] md:text-base">
                After that dream when she woke up, she heard from her mom that
                her grandfather has passed away leaving behind a legacy of
                spirituality of which Osheen ma will be the beacon. After that
                day her life took a turn where she dedicated herself into the
                realm of magic and spirituality and hence was born Osheen which
                means light and Oracle which mean a mentor acting as a medium
                through whom advice or prophecy was sought from gods.
